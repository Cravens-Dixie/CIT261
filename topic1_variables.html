            //variables are created with keyword **var**
            //variables can be typeof number, string, object, Boolean, and array
            //variables can be defined (var x = 1;), undefined (var x;), empty (var x = "";), and nullknown to exist now but it has no type or value)
            //variable names can include letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
            var firstName = "John"; //this is a string
            var lastName = "Doe";
            var age = 35; //this is a number, no "" needed

            //I could also have initialized all variables in one line like so:
            var firstName = "Jane", lastName = "Doe", age = 22;

            //to make it easier to read, it could also be typed this way:
            var
                firstName = "Mary",
                lastName = "BoPeep",
                age = 16;

            //let's add in some object and array type variables:
            
            //This is an object named "address". Objects have name:value pairs called PROPERTIES, and are separated by commas:
            //Objects can include a method (which is a function stored as a property). See the "fullAddress" property.
            var address = {
                houseNumber: "1415",
                streetName: "Shepherds Lane",
                city: "Sheepville",
                state: "CA", 
                fullAddress: function() {
                    return this.houseNumber + " " + this.streetName + ", " + this.city + ", " + this.state;
                }
            };
            
            //this is an Array. It can also be coded like the address object above with one item per line and a comma between items.
            var favFoods = ["cheese", "milk", "curds", "whey", "fruit"];
            
            //I want to change the first element from "cheese" to "cottage cheese"
            favFoods[0] = "cottage cheese";
            
            //I want to add an additional food to the array with the push()method.
            favFoods.push("chocolate bunny"); //adds "chocolate bunny" as the last item in the array. Array now has 6 items.
            
            //favFoods.pop();--would remove the last item in the array, which is "chocolate bunny" (but we won't do that right now).


            //now to get something up on the screen to see the JS in action:
            document.getElementById("topic1").innerHTML = firstName + " " + lastName + " " + "is " + age +
                " and lives at " + address.houseNumber + " " + address.streetName + "." +
                " Her favorite foods today are " + favFoods[0] + " and " + favFoods[favFoods.length - 1] + ".";
            //Notes:
            //Mary, BoPeep, and 16 are the last values stated for the same variable names. Thus, this is what is printed to screen.
            //Getting info out of an object is done with the object_name.property_name (such as address.houseNumber)
            //Array elements are accessed with array_name[number], starting with 0.  I used favFoods[0].
            //If the entire array is desired, just name the array with no index [] .So "favFoods" would have printed the entire array.
            //The length of an array is always one more than the highest array index. To access the last array item, use array_name.length - 1
            
            //Following document.getElementById is to show that the Object method works. Uncomment to make it work.
             //document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = address.fullAddress();
        </script>
